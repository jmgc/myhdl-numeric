Simulation
==========


.. _ref-simclass:

The :class:`Simulation` class
-----------------------------


.. class:: Simulation(arg [, arg ...])

   Class to construct a new simulation. Each argument should be a MyHDL instance.
   In MyHDL, an instance is recursively defined as being either a sequence of
   instances, or a MyHDL generator, or a Cosimulation object. See section
   :ref:`ref-gen` for the definition of MyHDL generators and their interaction with
   a :class:`Simulation` object.  See Section :ref:`ref-cosim` for the
   :class:`Cosimulation` object.  At most one :class:`Cosimulation` object can be
   passed to a :class:`Simulation` constructor.

A :class:`Simulation` object has the following method:


.. method:: Simulation.run([duration])

   Run the simulation forever (by default) or for a specified duration.


.. _ref-simsupport:

Simulation support functions
----------------------------


.. function:: now()

   Returns the current simulation time.


.. exception:: StopSimulation()

   Base exception that is caught by the ``Simulation.run()`` method to stop a
   simulation.


.. _ref-trace:

Waveform tracing
----------------


.. function:: traceSignals(func [, *args] [, **kwargs])

   Enables signal tracing to a VCD file for waveform viewing. *func* is a function
   that returns an instance. :func:`traceSignals` calls *func* under its control
   and passes *\*args* and *\*\*kwargs* to the call. In this way, it finds the
   hierarchy and the signals to be traced.

   The return value is the same as would be returned by the call ``func(*args,
   **kwargs)``.  The top-level instance name and the basename of the VCD output
   filename is ``func.func_name`` by default. If the VCD file exists already, it
   will be moved to a backup file by attaching a timestamp to it, before creating
   the new file.

   The ``traceSignals`` callable has the following attribute:


   .. attribute:: name

      This attribute is used to overwrite the default top-level instance name and the
      basename of the VCD output filename.

   .. attribute:: directory

      This attribute is used to set the directory to which VCD files are written. By
      default, the current working directory is used.

   .. attribute:: timescale

      This attribute is used to set the timescale corresponding to unit steps,
      according to the VCD format. The assigned value should be a string.
      The default timescale is "1ns".

.. _ref-sig:

Signals
-------

The :class:`SignalType` type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: SignalType

    This type is the abstract base type of all signals. It is not used to construct
    signals, but it can be used to check whether an object is a signal.



Regular signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Signal([val=None] [, delay=0])

   This class is used to construct a new signal and to initialize its value to
   *val*. Optionally, a delay can be specified.

   A :class:`Signal` object has the following attributes:

    .. attribute:: posedge

       Attribute that represents the positive edge of a signal, to be used in
       sensitivity lists.


    .. attribute:: negedge

       Attribute that represents the negative edge of a signal, to be used in
       sensitivity lists.


    .. attribute:: next

       Read-write attribute that represents the next value of the signal.


    .. attribute:: val

       Read-only attribute that represents the current value of the signal.

       This attribute is always available to access the current value; however in many
       practical case it will not be needed. Whenever there is no ambiguity, the Signal
       object's current value is used implicitly. In particular, all Python's standard
       numeric, bit-wise, logical and comparison operators are implemented on a Signal
       object by delegating to its current value. The exception is augmented
       assignment. These operators are not implemented as they would break the rule
       that the current value should be a read-only attribute. In addition, when a
       Signal object is assigned to the ``next`` attribute of another Signal object,
       its current value is assigned instead.


    .. attribute:: min

       Read-only attribute that is the minimum value (inclusive) of a numeric signal,
       or ``None`` for no minimum.


    .. attribute:: max

       Read-only attribute that is the maximum value (exclusive) of a numeric signal,
       or ``None`` for no  maximum.


    .. attribute:: driven
    
       Writable attribute that can be used to indicate that the signal is supposed to
       be driven from the MyHDL code, and possibly how it should be declared in Verilog after
       conversion. The allowed values are ``'reg'``, ``'wire'``, ``True`` and ``False``.

       This attribute is useful when the  converter cannot infer automatically
       whether and how a signal is driven. This occurs when the signal is driven from
       user-defined code. ``'reg'`` and ``'wire'`` are "true" values that
       permit finer control for the Verilog case.
  
    .. attribute:: read
    
       Writable boolean attribute that can be used to indicate that the signal is read.

       This attribute is useful when the converter cannot infer automatically
       whether a signal is read. This occurs when the signal is read from
       user-defined code.

   A :class:`Signal` object also has a call interface:

    .. method:: Signal.__call__(left[, right=None])

	This method returns a :class:`_SliceSignal` shadow signal. 


.. class:: ResetSignal(val, active, async)

    This Signal subclass defines reset signals. *val*, *active*, and *async*
    are mandatory arguments.
    *val* is a boolean value that specifies the intial value,
    *active* is a boolean value that specifies the active level.
    *async* is a boolean value that specifies the reset style:
    asynchronous (``True``) or synchronous (``False``).

    This class should be used in conjunction with the :func:`always_seq`
    decorator.

 
Shadow signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: _SliceSignal(sig, left[, right=None])

    This class implements read-only structural slicing and indexing. It creates a new
    shadow signal of the slice or index of the parent signal *sig*. If the
    *right* parameter is omitted, you get indexing instead of slicing.
    Parameters *left*  and *right* have the usual meaning for slice
    indices: in particular, *left* is non-inclusive but *right*
    is inclusive. *sig* should be appropriate for slicing and indexing, which
    means it should be based on :class:`intbv` in practice.

    The class constructor is not intended to be used explicitly. Instead,
    use the call interface of a regular signal.The following calls are equivalent::

        sl = _SliceSignal(sig, left, right)

        sl = sig(left, right)


.. class:: ConcatSignal(*args)

   This class creates a new shadow signal of the concatenation of its arguments. 

   You can pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the constructor.  The
   arguments should be bit-oriented with a defined number of bits.  The following
   argument types are supported: :class:`intbv` objects with a defined bit width,
   :class:`bool` objects, signals of the previous objects, and bit strings. 

   The new signal follows the value changes of the signal arguments. The non-signal
   arguments are used to define constant values in the concatenation.  

.. class:: TristateSignal(val)

    This class is used to construct a new tristate signal. The
    underlying type is specified by the *val*
    parameter. 
    It is a Signal subclass and has the usual attributes, with
    one exception: it doesn't support the ``next``
    attribute. Consequently, direct signal assignment to a tristate
    signal is not supported.
    The initial value is the tristate value ``None``.
    The current value of a tristate is determined by resolving the
    values from its drivers. When exactly one driver value is
    different from ``None``, that is the resolved value; otherwise
    it is ``None``. When more than one driver value is different
    from ``None``, a contention warning is issued.

    This class has the following method:

    .. method:: driver()

	Returns a new driver to the tristate signal. It is initialized to
	``None``.  A driver object is an instance of a special
	:class:`SignalType` subclass. In particular, its ``next``
	attribute can be used to assign a new value to it.



.. _ref-gen:

MyHDL generators and trigger objects
------------------------------------


.. index:: single: sensitivity list

MyHDL generators are standard Python generators with specialized
:keyword:`yield` statements. In hardware description languages, the equivalent
statements are called  *sensitivity lists*. The general format of
:keyword:`yield` statements in in MyHDL generators is:

:keyword:`yield` clause [, clause ...]

When a generator executes a :keyword:`yield` statement, its execution is
suspended at that point. At the same time, each *clause* is a *trigger object*
which defines the condition upon which the generator should be resumed. However,
per invocation of a :keyword:`yield` statement, the generator resumes exactly
once, regardless of the number of clauses. This happens on the first trigger
that occurs.

In this section, the trigger objects and their functionality will be described.

Some MyHDL objects that are described elsewhere can directly be used as trigger
objects. In particular, a :class:`Signal` can be used as a trigger object. Whenever a
signal changes value, the generator resumes. Likewise, the objects referred to
by the signal attributes ``posedge`` and ``negedge`` are trigger objects. The
generator resumes on the occurrence of a positive or a negative edge on the
signal, respectively. An edge occurs when there is a change from false to true
(positive) or vice versa (negative). For the full description of the
:class:`Signal` class and its attributes, see section :ref:`ref-sig`.

Furthermore, MyHDL generators can be used as clauses in ``yield`` statements.
Such a generator is forked, and starts operating immediately, while the original
generator waits for it to complete. The original generator resumes when the
forked generator returns.

In addition, the following functions return trigger objects:


.. function:: delay(t)

   Return a trigger object that specifies that the generator should resume after a
   delay *t*.


.. function:: join(arg [, arg ...])

   Join a number of trigger objects together and return a joined trigger object.
   The effect is that the joined trigger object will trigger when *all* of its
   arguments have triggered.

Finally, as a special case, the Python ``None`` object can be present in a
``yield`` statement. It is the do-nothing trigger object. The generator
immediately resumes, as if no ``yield`` statement were present. This can be
useful if the ``yield`` statement also has generator clauses: those generators
are forked, while the original generator resumes immediately.


.. _ref-deco:

Decorator functions
-------------------

MyHDL defines a number of decorator functions, that make it easier to create
generators from local generator functions.


.. function:: instance()

   The :func:`instance` decorator is the most general decorator.  It automatically
   creates a generator by calling the decorated generator function.

   It is used as follows::

      def top(...):
          ...
          @instance
          def inst():
              <generator body>
          ...
          return inst, ...

   This is equivalent to::

      def top(...):
          ...
          def _gen_func():
              <generator body>
          ...
          inst = _gen_func()
          ...
          return inst, ...


.. function:: always(arg [, *args])

   The :func:`always` decorator is a specialized decorator that targets a widely
   used coding pattern. It is used as follows::

      def top(...):
          ...
          @always(event1, event2, ...)
          def inst()
              <body>
          ...
          return inst, ...

   This is equivalent to the following::

      def top(...):
          ...
          def _func():
              <body>

          def _gen_func()
              while True:
                  yield event1, event2, ... 
                  _func()
          ...
          inst = _gen_func()
          ...
          return inst, ...

   The argument list of the decorator corresponds to the sensitivity list. Only
   signals, edge specifiers, or delay objects are allowed. The decorated function
   should be a classic function.


.. function:: always_comb()

   The :func:`always_comb` decorator is used to describe combinatorial logic. ::

      def top(...):
          ...
          @always_comb
          def comb_inst():
              <combinatorial body>
          ...
          return comb_inst, ...

   The :func:`always_comb` decorator infers the inputs of the combinatorial logic
   and the corresponding sensitivity list automatically. The decorated function
   should be a classic function.

.. function:: always_seq(edge, reset)

   The :func:`always_seq` decorator is used to describe sequential (clocked) logic.

   The *edge* parameter should be a clock edge (``clock.posedge`` or ``clock.negedge``).
   The *reset* parameter should a :class:`ResetSignal` object.


MyHDL data types
----------------

MyHDL defines a number of data types that are useful for hardware description.

.. _ref-intbv:

The :class:`intbv` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: intbv([val=0] [, min=None]  [, max=None])

    This class represents :class:`int`\ -like objects with some
    additional features that make it suitable for hardware
    design. 

    The *val* argument can be an :class:`int`, a
    :class:`long`, an :class:`intbv` or a bit string (a string with
    only '0's or '1's). For a bit string argument, the value is
    calculated as in ``int(bitstring, 2)``.  The optional *min* and
    *max* arguments can be used to specify the minimum and maximum
    value of the :class:`intbv` object. As in standard Python
    practice for ranges, the minimum value is inclusive and the
    maximum value is exclusive.

    The minimum and maximum values of an :class:`intbv` object are
    available as attributes:

    .. attribute:: min

       Read-only attribute that is the minimum value (inclusive) of an :class:`intbv`,
       or *None* for no minimum.


    .. attribute:: max

       Read-only attribute that is the maximum value (exclusive) of an :class:`intbv`,
       or *None* for no  maximum.

    .. method:: signed()

       Interpretes the msb bit as as sign bit and extends it into the higher-order
       bits of the underlying object value. The msb bit is the highest-order bit
       within the object's bit width.

    :rtype: integer

Unlike :class:`int` objects, :class:`intbv` objects are mutable; this is also
the reason for their existence. Mutability is needed to support assignment to
indexes and slices, as is common in hardware design. For the same reason,
:class:`intbv` is not a subclass from :class:`int`, even though :class:`int`
provides most of the desired functionality. (It is not possible to derive a
mutable subtype from an immutable base type.)

An :class:`intbv` object supports the same comparison, numeric, bitwise,
logical, and conversion operations as :class:`int` objects. See
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/typesnumeric.html for more information on
such operations. In all binary operations, :class:`intbv` objects can work
together with :class:`int` objects. For mixed-type numeric operations, the
result type is an :class:`int` or a :class:`long`. For mixed-type bitwise
operations, the result type is an :class:`intbv`.

In addition, :class:`intbv` supports a number of sequence operators. 
In particular, the :func:`len` function returns the object's bit width. Furthermore,
:class:`intbv` objects support indexing and slicing operations:

+-----------------+---------------------------------+--------+
| Operation       | Result                          | Notes  |
+=================+=================================+========+
| ``bv[i]``       | item *i* of *bv*                | \(1)   |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+--------+
| ``bv[i] = x``   | item *i* of *bv* is replaced by | \(1)   |
|                 | *x*                             |        |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+--------+
| ``bv[i:j]``     | slice of *bv* from *i* downto   | (2)(3) |
|                 | *j*                             |        |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+--------+
| ``bv[i:j] = t`` | slice of *bv* from *i* downto   | (2)(4) |
|                 | *j* is replaced by *t*          |        |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+--------+

(1)
   Indexing follows the most common hardware design conventions: the lsb bit is the
   rightmost bit, and it has index 0. This has the following desirable property: if
   the :class:`intbv` value is decomposed as a sum of powers of 2, the bit with
   index *i* corresponds to the term ``2**i``.

(2)
   In contrast to standard Python sequencing conventions, slicing range are
   downward. This is a consequence of the indexing convention, combined with the
   common convention that the most significant digits of a number are the leftmost
   ones. The Python convention of half-open ranges is followed: the bit with the
   highest index is not included. However, it is the *leftmost* bit in this case.
   As in standard Python, this takes care of one-off issues in many practical
   cases: in particular, ``bv[i:]`` returns *i* bits; ``bv[i:j]`` has ``i-j`` bits.
   When the low index *j* is omitted, it defaults to ``0``. When the high index *i*
   is omitted, it means "all" higher order bits.

(3)
   The object returned from a slicing access operation is always a positive
   :class:`intbv`; higher order bits are implicitly assumed to be zero. The bit
   width is implicitly stored in the return object, so that it can be used in
   concatenations and as an iterator. In addition, for a bit width w, the *min* and
   *max* attributes are implicitly set to ``0`` and ``2**w``, respectively.

(4)
   When setting a slice to a value, it is checked whether the slice is wide enough.

In addition, an :class:`intbv` object supports the iterator protocol. This makes
it possible to iterate over all its bits, from the high index to index 0. This
is only possible for :class:`intbv` objects with a defined bit width.

.. _ref-modvb:

The :class:`modbv` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: modbv([val=0] [, min=None]  [, max=None])

   The :class:`modbv` class implements modular bit vector types.

   It is implemented as a subclass of :class:`intbv`
   and supports the same parameters and operators.
   The difference is in the handling of the *min* and *max* boundaries.
   Instead of throwing an exception when those constraints are exceeded,
   the value of :class:`modbv` objects wraps around according to the
   following formula::
  
       val = (val - min) % (max - min) + min
       
   This formula is a generalization of modulo wrap-around behavior that
   is often useful when describing hardware system behavior. 

The :func:`enum` factory function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: enum(arg [, arg ...] [, encoding='binary'])

   Returns an enumeration type.

   The arguments should be string literals that represent the desired names of the
   enumeration type attributes.  The returned type should be assigned to a type
   name.  For example::

      t_EnumType = enum('ATTR_NAME_1', 'ATTR_NAME_2', ...)

   The enumeration type identifiers are available as attributes of the type name,
   for example: ``t_EnumType.ATTR_NAME_1``

   The optional keyword argument *encoding* specifies the encoding scheme used in
   Verilog output. The available encodings are ``'binary'``, ``'one_hot'``, and
   ``'one_cold'``.


.. _ref-model-misc:

Modeling support functions
--------------------------

MyHDL defines a number of additional support functions that are
useful for hardware description.

:func:`bin`
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: bin(num [, width])

   Returns a bit string representation. If the optional *width* is provided, and if
   it is larger than the width of the default representation, the bit string is
   padded with the sign bit.

   This function complements the standard Python conversion functions ``hex`` and
   ``oct``. A binary string representation is often useful in hardware design.

   :rtype: string

:func:`concat`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: concat(base [, arg ...])

   Returns an :class:`intbv` object formed by concatenating the arguments.

   The following argument types are supported: :class:`intbv` objects with a
   defined bit width, :class:`bool` objects, signals of the previous objects, and
   bit strings. All these objects have a defined bit width. 

   The first argument *base* is special as it does not need to have a 
   defined bit width. In addition to
   the previously mentioned objects, unsized :class:`intbv`, :class:`int` and
   :class:`long` objects are supported, as well as signals of such objects.

   :rtype: :class:`intbv`


:func:`downrange`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: downrange(high [, low=0])

   Generates a downward range list of integers.

   This function is modeled after the standard ``range`` function, but works in the
   downward direction. The returned interval is half-open, with the *high* index
   not included. *low* is optional and defaults to zero.  This function is
   especially useful in conjunction with the :class:`intbv` class, that also works
   with downward indexing.

:func:`instances`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: instances()

   Looks up all MyHDL instances in the local name space and returns them in a list.

   :rtype: list


.. _ref-cosim:

Co-simulation
=============

.. _ref-cosim-myhdl:

MyHDL
-----


.. class:: Cosimulation(exe, **kwargs)

   Class to construct a new Cosimulation object.

   The *exe* argument is the command to execute an HDL simulation, which can be
   either a string of the entire command line or a list of strings.
   In the latter case, the first element is the executable, and subsequent elements
   are program arguments. Providing a list of arguments allows Python to correctly
   handle spaces or other characters in program arguments.

   The *kwargs* keyword arguments provide a named association between signals (regs &
   nets) in the HDL simulator and signals in the MyHDL simulator. Each keyword
   should be a name listed in a ``$to_myhdl`` or ``$from_myhdl`` call in the HDL
   code. Each argument should be a :class:`Signal` declared in the MyHDL code.


.. _ref-cosim-verilog:

Verilog
-------


.. function:: $to_myhdl(arg, [, arg ...])

   Task that defines which signals (regs & nets) should be read by the MyHDL
   simulator. This task should be called at the start of the simulation.


.. function:: $from_myhdl(arg, [, arg ...])

   Task that defines which signals should be driven by the MyHDL simulator. In
   Verilog, only regs can be specified. This task should be called at the start of
   the simulation.



.. _ref-conv:

Conversion to Verilog and VHDL
==============================



.. _ref-conv-conv:

Conversion
----------


.. function:: toVerilog(func [, *args] [, **kwargs])

     Converts a MyHDL design instance to equivalent Verilog code, and also generates
     a test bench to verify it. *func* is a function that returns an instance.
     :func:`toVerilog` calls *func* under its control and passes *\*args* and
     *\*\*kwargs* to the call.

     The return value is the same as would be returned by the call ``func(*args,
     **kwargs)``. It should be assigned to an instance name.

     The top-level instance name and the basename of the Verilog output filename is
     ``func.func_name`` by default.

     For more information about the restrictions on convertible MyHDL code, see
     section :ref:`conv-subset` in Chapter :ref:`conv`.

    :func:`toVerilog` has the following attribute:

    .. attribute:: name

       This attribute is used to overwrite the default top-level instance name and the
       basename of the Verilog output filename.

    .. attribute:: directory

       This attribute is used to set the directory to which converted verilog
       files are written. By default, the current working directory is used.

    .. attribute:: timescale

       This attribute is used to set the timescale in Verilog format. The assigned value
       should be a string. The default timescale is "1ns/10ps".


.. function:: toVHDL(func[, *args][, **kwargs])

    Converts a MyHDL design instance to equivalent VHDL
    code. *func* is a function that returns an instance. :func:`toVHDL`
    calls *func* under its control and passes *\*args* and
    *\*\*kwargs* to the call.

    The return value is the same as would be returned by the call
    ``func(*args, **kwargs)``. It can be assigned to an instance name.
    The top-level instance name and the basename of the Verilog
    output filename is ``func.func_name`` by default.
	
    :func:`toVHDL` has the following attributes:

    .. attribute:: name

       This attribute is used to overwrite the default top-level
       instance name and the basename of the VHDL output.

    .. attribute:: directory

       This attribute is used to set the directory to which converted VHDL
       files are written. By default, the current working directory is used.

    .. attribute:: component_declarations

       This attribute can be used to add component declarations to the
       VHDL output. When a string is assigned to it, it will be copied
       to the appropriate place in the output file.

    .. attribute:: library 

       This attribute can be used to set the library in the VHDL output
       file. The assigned value should be a string. The default 
       library is ``work``.

    .. attribute:: std_logic_ports

       This boolean attribute can be used to have only ``std_logic`` type
       ports on the top-level interface (when ``True``) instead of the
       default ``signed/unsigned`` types (when ``False``, the default). 



.. _ref-conv-user:

User-defined Verilog and VHDL code
----------------------------------

User-defined code can be inserted in the Verilog or VHDL output through
the use of function attributes. Suppose a function :func:`<func>` defines
a hardware module. User-defined code can be specified for the function
with the following function attributes:

.. attribute:: <func>.vhdl_code

    A template string for user-defined code in the VHDL output.

.. attribute:: <func>.verilog_code

    A template string for user-defined code in the Verilog output.

When such a function attribute is defined, the normal conversion
process is bypassed and the user-defined code is inserted instead.
The template strings should be suitable for the standard
:class:`string.Template` constructor. They can contain interpolation
variables (indicated by a ``$`` prefix) for all signals in the
context. Note that the function attribute can be defined anywhere where
:func:`<func>` is visible, either outside or inside the function
itself.

These function attributes cannot be used with generator functions or
decorated local functions, as these are not elaborated before
simulation or conversion.  In other words, they can only be used with
functions that define structure.


Conversion output verification
==============================

.. module:: myhdl.conversion

MyHDL provides an interface to verify converted designs. 
This is used extensively in the package itself to verify the conversion
functionality. This capability is exported by the package so that users
can use it also.

Verification interface
----------------------

All functions related to conversion verification are implemented in
the :mod:`myhdl.conversion` package.

.. function:: verify(func[, *args][, **kwargs])

    Used like :func:`toVHDL()` and  :func:`toVerilog()`. It converts MyHDL code,
    simulates both the MyHDL code and the HDL code and reports any
    differences. The default HDL simulator is GHDL.

    This function has the following attribute:

    .. attribute:: simulator

       Used to set the name of the HDL simulator. ``"GHDL"``
       is the default.

.. function:: analyze(func[, *args][, **kwargs])

    Used like :func:`toVHDL()` and :func:`toVerilog()`. It converts MyHDL code, and analyzes the
    resulting HDL. 
    Used to verify whether the HDL output is syntactically correct.

    This function has the following attribute:

    .. attribute:: simulator

       Used to set the name of the HDL simulator used to analyze the code. ``"GHDL"``
       is the default.


HDL simulator registration
--------------------------

To use a HDL simulator to verify conversions, it needs to
be registered first. This is needed once per simulator.

A number of HDL simulators are preregistered in the
MyHDL distribution, as follows:

+-----------------+---------------------------------+
| Identifier      | Simulator                       |
+=================+=================================+
| ``"GHDL"``      | The GHDL VHDL simulator         |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+
| ``"vsim"``      | The ModelSim VHDL simulator     |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+
| ``"icarus"``    | The Icarus Verilog simulator    |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+
| ``"cver"``      | The cver Verilog simulator      |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+
| ``"vlog"``      | The Modelsim VHDL simulator     |
+-----------------+---------------------------------+

Of course, a simulator has to be installed before it can be used.

If another simulator is required, it has to be registered by the user.
This is done with the function :func:`registerSimulation` that lives
in the module :mod:`myhdl.conversion._verify`. The same module also has the
registrations for the predefined simulators.

The verification functions work by comparing the HDL simulator
output with the MyHDL simulator output. Therefore, they have
to deal with the specific details of each HDL simulator output,
which may be somewhat tricky. This is reflected in the interface
of the :func:`registerSimulation` function. As registration
is rarely needed, this interface is not further described here.

Please refer to the source code in :mod:`myhdl.conversion._verify`
to learn how registration works. If you need help, please
contact the MyHDL community.
