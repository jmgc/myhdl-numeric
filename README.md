Installation
------------
If you have superuser power, you can install MyHDL as follows:

```

This will install the package in the appropriate site-wide Python
package location.

Otherwise, you can install it in a personal directory, e.g. as
follows:

```
python setup.py install --home=$HOME
```

In this case, be sure to add the appropriate install dir to the
``$PYTHONPATH``.

If necessary, consult the distutils documentation in the standard
Python library if necessary for more details;
or contact me.

You can test the proper installation as follows:

```
cd myhdl/test/core
py.test
```

To install co-simulation support:

Go to the directory ``cosimulation/<platform>`` for your target platform
and following the instructions in the ``README.txt`` file.
